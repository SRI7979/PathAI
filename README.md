# PathAI iOS UI Prototype

This repository contains a SwiftUI prototype that recreates the dark, card-based calorie tracker UI shown in the reference.

## What's Included
- SwiftUI layout with gradient background and card surfaces
- Progress rings, macro cards, and a recent upload card
- Modular view components for easy iteration

## Open in Xcode
1. Create a new Xcode iOS App project named `PathAI` (SwiftUI lifecycle).
2. Replace the generated `ContentView.swift` and app entry file with the files in `PathAIApp/`.
3. Run the project on an iOS simulator.

## Notes
This repo focuses on the UI layout and styling rather than functional data bindings.
